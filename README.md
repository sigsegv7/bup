# The Bup programming language

## Why?

Bup is a systems-level programming language inspired by C and aimed to be as explicit
as possible. Its philosophy is whatever the currently executing program is doing should
be exactly up to the programmer. The programmer should be the one controlling the compiler,
not the other way around.

> [!WARNING]
> Bup is currently still pre-alpha software and is undergoing
> rapid development. Please be patient as we release new features.

Example language files can be found within the ``ref/`` directory.
